# GPNET

### Abstract

Environmental estrogens (EEs), as typical endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), can bind to classic estrogen nuclear receptors (ERs) to induce genomic effects, as well as to G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) located on the cytoplasmic membrane, thereby inducing downstream non-genomic effects rapidly. However, due to the relatively scarce ligand data, receptor-based or ligand-based screening model is challenging. Inspired by functional similarity between GPER and ER, this study takes GPER as an example and constructs a deep transfer learning model named GPNET to predict potential GPER binding ligands by using molecular surface three-dimensional (3D) electrostatic potential point clouds as input. The model retains a part of molecular structural knowledge learned from the ER ligands and then trains the remaining parameters of the model using the GPER ligands, ultimately obtaining GPNET model, which effectively predicts the binding activity of compounds with GPER.

# Setup and dependencies

Dependenciesï¼š

- python 3.10.4
- pytorch 1.12.1
- numpy 1.22.3
- pandas 1.4.3

# Usage

### 1. How to preprocess the raw data
First, You need prepare txt files containing compound labels and point-cloud information.

For labels file, whose format is like below:
```
compound1 label
compound2 label
...
```

For point-cloud files, whose format is like below:
```
x y z esp
...
```

Using npz files to compress and save the above information:
```python
python data_npz.py 
```

## 2. How to train the models. 
Instance the model object and do training.
```python
python GPNET-trainer.py 
```
Loss, AUC-ROC on training set and validation set will be saved as txt files and network parameters after each training epoch will be saved.

## 3. How to do prediction
 ```
    python GPNET.py -o result.csv -t False
   ```
**-o** is the specified results saved file.
**-t** is the specified output format, which defaults to True, exporting the predicted labels. 
If you want to know the predicted binding possibility(score) of compound, you can specify it to False.
